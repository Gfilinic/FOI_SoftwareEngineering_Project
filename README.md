## Domain description
Everybody has ordered pizza at least once, but a lot of the people order it pretty often. Whenever we order, we lose some time because the clerk needs to process our order and this happens when everything is going smoothly. Then there are other times when the line will be busy so you will need to call again, or there won't be some ingredient so you need to quickly think of substitute pizza and sometimes you will find out rather late that you will need to wait for over 90 minutes before they deliver the pizza for you. As a solution to this problem, this application will be made. The main goal of this application will be to make it easier for customers to order pizza through opportunities like being able to order each ingredient of the pizza separately and you will see if some ingredient is missing immediately. Also, you will be able to see, depending on the number of current orders, the estimated time for when the pizza will be delivered before even ordering anything.
