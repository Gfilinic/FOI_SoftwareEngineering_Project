## Domain description
Everybody has ordered pizza at least once, but a lot of the people order it pretty often. Whenever we order, we lose some time because the clerk needs to process our order and this happens when everything is going smoothly. Then there are other times when the line will be busy so you will need to call again, or there won't be some ingredient so you need to quickly think of substitute pizza and sometimes you will find out rather late that you will need to wait for over 90 minutes before they deliver the pizza for you. As a solution to this problem, this application will be made. The main goal of this application will be to make it easier for customers to order pizza through opportunities like being able to order each ingredient of the pizza separately and you will see if some ingredient is missing immediately. Also, you will be able to see, depending on the number of current orders, the estimated time for when the pizza will be delivered before even ordering anything.

## Technology and equipment
We will be using the following technology:

1.  GitHub
2.  Visual Studio 2019
3.  Differ
4.  Microsoft Word 2019
5.  Draw.io

GitHub will be our main "headquarters", the place where we will keep track of our work by uploading whenever we do something on our project. Visual Studio 2019 is programming environment where we will be coding our program in C#. In Differ we as team will comunicate and inform each other about deadlines and similar stuff. In Microsoft Word 2019 we will document most of the stuff that we do. In Draw.io we will draw tables, diagram and other stuff that pops along our way.
