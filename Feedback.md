## General feedback
Good project idea. It is accepted with greetings. The few enhancements are described below in separated section. The proposed project fits in the course framework and when implemented the students will achieve the planned learning outcomes. Please read comments bellow and update your project idea accordingly. 

## Software architecture in relation to database
I kind ask your software architecture to be based on centralized database (access to which your already got from assistant Mijaƒç). Thus, more than one app should be able to connect to the database at same time. This aspect, if applicable, should be taken into consideration when designing other feathers (e.g. when two users are ordering pizza with similar ingredients at the same time, but amount of resources of chosen ingredient is enough for only one pizza). 

## The improvements of the system
1. Please make your product for more than one potential buyer. This means that you should be able to sell this app to more than one pizzeria. Each buyer gets one super admin account which than handles everything for its pizzeria.
2. Please make your reports, bills and other document exportable to PDF.
3. Please ensure the possibility of sending the proper documents (e.g. bills) to e-mail of user. 
4. Please create the possibility of sending the user an email (or in app) notification that his pizza is ready and with planned delivery time.

Please update your proposal and define team member responsibilities as soon as possible. Please try to make every team member has the approximately the same amount of work.
